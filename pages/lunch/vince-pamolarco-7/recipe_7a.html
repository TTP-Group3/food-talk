            <h1>Instructions:</h1>

            • Start by pan-frying the potato and carrots. Heat oil in a pan. Add potato. Fry each side for 1 minute. Remove from the pan and put in a bowl lined with paper towel. Set aside. Do the same thing with the carrots. 
            <br>
            • Using the remaining oil, fry the chicken for 1 ½ minutes per side. Remove from the pan. Set aside. 
            <br>
            • Saute onion and garlic. Add tomato. Continue to saute while stirring until tomato and onion softens. 
            <br>
            • Add chicken and pour-in tomato sauce and water. Let boil. 
            <br>
            • Stir and then add Knorr Chicken Cube and chili pepper. Cover the pan. Cook between low to medium heat for 15 minutes. 
            <br>
            • Turn the chicken pieces over to equally cook the opposite side. Add liver spread. Stir. Cover and cook for 20 minutes. 
            <br>
            • Add bell peppers and cheese. Cook for 3 minutes. 
            <br>
            • Put the carrots and potatoes into the pan. Continue to cook for 5 to 7 minutes. 
            <br>
            • Season with salt and ground black pepper. Serve. Share and enjoy.
